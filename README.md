# Student Complaint Management System  

This project is a **Student Complaint Management System prototype** developed in **Java** as part of my college coursework. The app demonstrates how to build a simple complaint management system using **AWT, Swing, ArrayLists**, and **Java I/O** for file handling.

## **Features**  
- **User Authentication:**  
  - Sign-in and Login functionality for secure access.  

- **Raise Complaints:**  
  - A home page where students can raise complaints.  

- **Data Storage:**  
  - Complaints are saved in a local text file.  
  - New complaints are appended to the file for persistent storage.  

---

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Language:** Java  
- **GUI Frameworks:** AWT, Swing  
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList  
- **File Handling:** Java I/O  

---

## **How It Works**  
1. **Sign-In/Sign-Up:**  
   Users are required to sign in to access the system.  

2. **Home Page:**  
   After logging in, users are redirected to the home page where they can raise a complaint.  

3. **File Storage:**  
   - Complaints are stored locally in a text file (`complaints.txt`).  
   - If multiple complaints are raised, they are appended to the same file.  

---

## **Future Scope**  
- **Database Integration:**  
  Replace the local file storage with a database for better scalability.  

- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Create an interface for the college administration to view and manage complaints.  

- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  Host the app for accessibility across devices and systems.

## **Learning Highlights**  
This project helped me explore:  
- Building GUIs with AWT and Swing.  
- Managing data dynamically with ArrayLists.  
- File handling using Java I/O streams.  

I also extensively used **ChatGPT** to learn and troubleshoot as these topics were new to me. This process improved my problem-solving skills and made me better at writing effective prompts.
